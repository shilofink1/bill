            <button class="accordion">Relationships</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>County employees and County residents, it's not just the City of Havre, it's the whole county. We need to listen to what they have to say because what they say matter just as much as the next person.</p>
                </div>
            
            <button class="accordion">County Roads</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Out of 56 counties in Montana, Hill County is 18th in amount of area, 12th in population, but 5th in number county roads! We need to look at how our roads are maintained to make driving to work, school, or wherever possible. We all know the winters are harsh on the High Line, the last thing that we need are poor road conditions and potholes to turn a trip to the store into a trip to the Emergency Room.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>Equipment and gravel are issues, I will be seeking ways to maintain our equipment so the hard working men and women who do this job can do it right.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>SB442 – Nonpartisan bill – 50 plus million was to be re-distributed that included county roads and veterans. This needs to be revisited with people like our friend Paul Tuss ,the funding is there, it just isn't going to the places it needs to.</p>
                </div>
            <button class="accordion">Havre Water Situation</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>This also has affected many county residents that do not live in Havre, but county residents who rely on this service. Water is one of the most valuable resources, and we can't have people who already stuggle with paying bills to now buy water.</p>
                </div>
            <button class="accordion">Illegal Drugs</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Specifically, fentanyl and meth continue to be a public health crisis. People roam the streets in need of help and they have nowhere to go because drugs have impacted their lives in some way. We must do something about these drugs that plague our community, we hear you calling out in need, now it's time to do something about it.</p>
                </div>
            <button class="accordion">Mental Health Issues</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Sometime life on the High Line gets hard and we need somewhere to turn to talk about our mental health. Their is a lack of mental health care in Hill County and the sooner we recognize the imporatance of our mental health the sooner we can pursue and adopt measures to help us all out.</p>
                </div>
            <button class="accordion">Property Taxes</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Our community keeps asking for more funding, however we ask everyone if they want to increase propery taxes instead of just those who own property. It isn't fair for someone to put words in your mouth, and it's not fair for someone to tell you where to spend your money.</p>
