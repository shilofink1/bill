            My Story
            </h2>
            <p>I was born in Great Falls and graduated from Great Falls High School. I then attended Northern Montana College and received Associate, Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from Northern. After attending Northern I worked at Northern for more than 20 years as the Director of Residence Life, Director of Student Life and Assistant Dean of Students. I have also worked for Blaine County in the Clerk & Recorder’s Office, Hill County as the Director of the Hill County Senior Center and for the State of Montana as a Workforce Consultant in the Job Service-Havre office.

            <p>
                I have also been in active in the Boy Scouts of America program for more than 30 years as scout and as leader. While in high school I earned the Rank of Eagle Scout and I am currently a Life time member of the National Eagle Scout Association. Other activities that I have been a part of include; Bullhook Community Health Center Board of Directors, Havre Dog Park, Northern Athletic Hall of Fame Committee, Northern Alumni Association, HELP Committee, Havre Crime Stoppers Board and the Havre Eagles Club. I have a passion for working in the community to create opportunities for everyone to enjoy and connect over. Havre has a rich history and a lot to offer, the more you put into it the more you get out of it! Below is a list of community projects I have had the pleasure of serving on, or are still currently volunteering my time.
